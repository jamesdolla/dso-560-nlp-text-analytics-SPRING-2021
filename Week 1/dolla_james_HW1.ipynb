    "You are a business analyst working for a major US toy retailer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A manager in the marketing department wants to find out the most frequently used words in positive reviews (five stars) and negative reviews (one star) in order to determine what occasion the toys are purchased for (Christmas, birthdays, and anniversaries.). He would like your opinion on **which gift occasions (Christmas, birthdays, or anniversaries) tend to have the most positive reviews** to focus marketing budget on those days.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are malformed characters in the review text. For instance, notice the `&#34;` - these are examples of incorrectly decoded [HTML encodings](https://krypted.com/utilities/html-encoding-reference/).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"amazing quality first of all, these cards are amazing proxies (but don't try to use em in &#34;official duels&#34; unless a judge is okay with it, if you have the real thing to show) and look amazing in your binder!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Please clean up all instances of these incorrect decodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One of your product managers suspects that **toys purchased for male recipients (husbands, sons, etc.)** tend to be much more likely to be reviewed poorly. She would like to see some data points confirming or rejecting her hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **regular expressions to parse out all references to recipients and gift occassions**, and account for the possibility that people may spell words \"son\" / \"children\" / \"Christmas\" as both singular and plural, upper or lower-cased.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explain what some of **pitfalls/limitations** are of using only a word count analysis to make these inferences. What additional research/steps would you need to do to verify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Create a simple text file that contains 2-3 lines at most describing yourself, your background, and interests. It must contain at least 1 emoji and 4-5 international characters (non-ASCII)**. Make sure to properly encode the file so that I can open it in `UTF-8` to read. I must be able to read all characters properly. Attach it to your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform the same word count analysis using the reviews received from Amazon to answer your marketing manager's question. They are stored in two files, (`poor_amazon_toy_reviews.txt`) and (`good-amazon-toy-reviews.txt`). **Provide a few sentences with your findings and business recommendations.** Make any assumptions you'd like to- this is a fictitious company after all. I just want you to get into the habit of \"finishing\" your analysis: to avoid delivering technical numbers to a non-technical manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submit everything as a new notebook and Slack direct message to me (Yu Chen) and the TA the HW as an attachment.**\n",

We bought a Syma X8HG for $135 on Amazon, and it is AWESOME.  Both my sons have them, my older son has the cheaper one without altitude hold and we love them.  The X8 series starts at $58 believe it or not, and they are MUCH, MUCH better quadcopters.  The Ares is JUNK compared to the Syma!!!\"\\n',\n",

I was going to return them, but my kid found them first and, being only 2, his standards are low. But, within minutes he had a frustrated meltdown over the fact that they wont stand, and so any that didn\\'t have 4 legs went in the trash. Which meant 6 of them.

       " '\"Ok so this is plastic spaceship for a toddler.  I am not looking for German quality engineering here but this product is ridiculous.  The factory / designer made no effort whatsoever to calibrate their design so it actually works.<br /><br />Issues :<br />1, The space helmet has no way staying on the astronaut, the sizing is so off the sits on his head like he just grabbed the closes planter near by and called it a helmet.  Trying to place the astronaut in the spaceship with the helmet on is impossible.  There is not enough clearance to close the cockpit. So the helmet is useless, it just constantly falls off causing frustration.<br /><br />2, Ok issue number one can be explained by, oh son he does not need the helmet in the spaceship ok.....  However, the pilot itself it to large for the cockpit. A person really has to finagle and shove the guy in there to fit and for the cockpit to close.  Same goes for getting him in and out again  This is BS since the fundamental point of the toy.<br /><br />Dear toy maker, let me tell you the &#34;User Story&#34; for the product. Three year old using imagination play with spaceship and astronout having adventures.  For this the astronout has to be able to get in and out of his spaceship and travel to other locations and rinse and repeat.  What they should not be doing is getting frustrating with trying put together 3 pieces of outerly poorly designed garbage..\"\\n',\n",

The puzzle itself is darker than the photo on the package and this in turn made it difficult to identify pieces.  There was also relatively little variation in the shape of the pieces so that--in areas where there as no pattern to use as a guide (see upper left)--it was very easy to substitute a wrong piece for the correct one.  We were willing to put up with these last two issues given the beauty of the painting on which the puzzle is based.  But to find out that we were 6 pieces short after working on the puzzle for more than a week, was the last straw.  We\\'ll stick to Ravensburger puzzles from now on.\"\\n',\n",

I refer to your Cell Block Psycho childrenâ\\x80\\x99s costume with the description that reads, &#34;Kids will look psychotic with our scary Cell Block Psycho Child Costume. With a look resembling Hannibal Lector, no other convict will dare mess with this one. Our kids\\' Cell Block Psycho Costume includes an orange prisoner jumpsuit featuring torn sleeves, one attached tattoo sleeve, zipper front and \\'Ward 10-31 print, broken wrist shackle and a brown half face constraint mask. The molded plastic half mask features bars over the mouthpiece cutout for the scary look of Hannibal Lector the cannibal. No one on their cell block will dare to mess with this serial kill mental patient in our scary Cell Block Psycho Costume for kids.&#34; My younger daughter, once an honor student, athlete and musician before her illness presented during the onset of adolescence, has lived with schizoaffective disorder for the past six years, and was hospitalized as a child.  Weâ\\x80\\x99ve taken her to UCLA and Stanford, as well as our local hospitals, hoping to make sense of her devastating illness.  If you have ever spent anytime visiting a loved one in a childrenâ\\x80\\x99s/adolescentâ\\x80\\x99s mental health treatment facility, I assure you, you would understand that this costume is painfully cruel. Childhood suffering is not an appropriate inspiration for a Halloween costume.  Vampires are not real.  Mummies come-to-life, monsters and zombies are not real.  Cartoon characters, fairy princesses and action heroes are not real.  Those types of costumes are appropriate to sell for children for Halloween.  But childhood and adolescent mental illness is very real.  I doubt you would sell a Stage Four Cancer costume.  Why would you sell a costume that makes fun of a severe brain disorder? Stigma only encourages hopelessness and despair.  Please reconsider stigmatizing our daughterâ\\x80\\x99s very real illness by removing your Cell Block Psycho Costume and other mental illness inspired costumes from your inventory.\"\\n',\n",

The bag contained 3 colors of chests--purple, pink, and orange.

Having read a few of the negative reviews, I realized that I needed to test the chests before I brought them to school. The first pink chest closed just fine. The next one was was missing a tab that secures the &#34;lock&#34;--it didn\\'t stay closed. A third purple chest was missing a tab, so of course that one wouldn\\'t stay closed. I tested 20 of these chests, and only 6 would stay closed. After some quick calculating I realized that out of 144 chests, there probably were only around 40 that would stay closed.

       " '\"This set is poorly designed junk. The hockey puck does not slide on ordinary paved surfaces, nor would it work on grass. Useless. The soccer ball is pathetic. Its basically a dog toy sold in a set for kids. You can get a much better soccer ball for children at any sports store. As for the sticks and net, what you are getting is basically HALF of what you need to have any real fun. You get one net, and two sticks. But there are four attachments for those sticks: two hockey and two lacrosse. The attachments go on by way of a crude lock-in system that requires pushing very gently on a button-- to make the attachments go on-- but that requires a very HARD push to get them off again. My son and I could not get the lacrosse attachments off the sticks except by squeezing HARD on that button. Unfortunately, one of the buttons was squeezed so hard that it went in-- and did not pop back out again. Now that stick is junk. We have just one stick now and its staying on its lacrosse setting. You\\'ll need to buy extra sticks if you want to enjoy this set with less stress, so that your hockey and lacrosse sticks are ready when your kids are and don\\'t need to be changed. But I wouldn\\'t even bother buying this set for its sticks because they are made from clunky metal-- why not just get your kids the right sized, lower-end equipment made from wood or plastic and that requires no assembly? The set makes enjoying sports horribly complicated.<br /><br />The net went together easily enough, but its not something I\\'d want to take apart and do over again each time they wanted to play. So it takes up a large part of our basement. What I dislike most about the set is the cheapness of the materials. It has great gift appeal: It was my preschooler\\'s favorite birthday present and his 7-year-old brother was even excited when it was opened. The picture on the box had my kids giddy to take it out right away. But once we had it out, and realized how little there really was to play with, the qualityof which was all around inferior, our excitement waned and this toy will probably make an appearance in next year\\'s yard sale. Its a flashy toy with excellent gift appeal: Its best use is pretend-play for little kids. But keep in mind it has all the caveats of a self-assembled toy.\"\\n',\n",

The first time it put it in the water it ran for about a minute and stopped steering. Retrieved it and it was full of water which killed the steering servo.  Sent it back for an exchange. Got the new one and it did the same thing within a minute.  Here\\'s the list of modifications I had to do to make it right.  1 - steering linkage wire is way to thin and does not make a watertight seal through the cheap rubber seal in the hull.  Had to fabricate a new through-hull seal.  2- when you reverse the boat it floods because the hull is 2 pieces and NOT sealed with any kind of glue or rubber.  Tried to separate the hull and the nose is glued in place so removing the 4 screws only allowed the rear pieces to partially separate. Used aquaseal around the seam where I could.  The connection plug to the steering servo gets wet with the slightest amount of water in the hull so agua sealed the plug. 3 - even when the steering servo worked, it does not push the rudder to its limits so the boat barely steers.  Had to fabricate extension levers for both the servo and the rudder to get the servo to push the rudder to its limits.  the rudder also had a tab that stopped it from steering to the limit on 1 side so had to grind that off as well.  SAVE YOUR MONEY - and buy a product that has had some R&D put into it.  After about 6 hours of labor in my workshop the thing finally works for more than a minute - it does go fast though but seriously not worth the money or effort.

First of all, the head separated to several parts in the first place, so that I have to carefully connect them together which is a very complicated work to do. But it is just a beginning. I also figured out that the tail can not be connected to the body because the articulation is basically wrong ! The hold used to articulate is way too small, it is impossible to connect the tail. Moreover, other articulations are very easy to detach, especially the toes. When I tried to adjust the post, they just detached. It is very uncommon. The quality should not suppose to be that terrible. Therefore, I have to conclude that it is a faulty product. Ironically, the seller is Amazon.Com. I don\\'t know if they did it for purpose.

Be prepared to want to shoot yourself in the head after playing it for the umpteenth time in a row, but fun enough to entertain a preschooler (though would get boring pretty fast for an older child). Gameplay is simple enough to allow for young kiddos to play independently of an adult (if that is an option for you!) For like the $5-6 I paid for it, the game is interchangeable for just cheap but pretty sturdy pirate toys (even recycle the sword into a safe, lightweight Halloween costume accessory), so worth the price on that note alone. On the one hand, I love that the map (which you can\\'t really see in the picture) is also a bag to hold the game, but would\\'ve preferred that the game packaging was reusable as a box as the map gets &#34;deformed&#34; by stuffing all the pieces in it and becomes somewhat of a pain to use as the flat playing surface necessary for the game (especially if you are not interested in pulling the little plastic stands off the treasure pieces every time which I imagine would also decrease the life of the pieces). This is of course easily solved by say putting it all in a gallon or bigger sized ziplock, or another box you have around, especially if you\\'d like it to stack nicely with your other games, but since I had to chuck all the packaging, would have been less wasteful if it was reusable. Overall, a fun and inexpensive game for the younger set which can be made super simple or a bit more challenging depending on how serious you are about hiding the treasure, and fun game/pirate-play pieces (just don\\'t lose them!).\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"Really cute doll, nice quality, cute clothes, 11 y.o. daughter loves it :o)<br /><br />In my opinion the American Girls Dolls are seriously over priced and absolutely do not offer any superior quality oer the Madame Alexander dolls. It reminds me of the cabbage patch kids craze when folks would pay hundreds for those, only difference is that they had no competition of any sort, whereas the American Girl Dolls have  tons of competition with other dolls of same size, idea, and quality. The Madame Alexander Dolls are a prime example.<br /><br />This doll is really cute and my daughter really likes her. She says that the doll is cute, her outfit is cute and she especially loves the boots, She has 2-3 other Madame Alexander dolls plus 2 of the Springfield Collection dolls (sold at Michaels craft stores - cute but there are differences that make them obviously less expensively made than the Madame Alexander & American Girls.) She loves all her dolls and in fact has stated several times that she thinks the Madame Alexander dolls are &#34;cuter and have more personality&#34; than the American Girl Dolls.<br /><br />Summary: Cute, good quality doll, good buy\"\\n',\n",

It has so many activities for him to choose from and he especially seems to like the steering wheel.  Although we haven\\'t used it other than on the table, if you have a younger child that isn\\'t standing yet you can take the play top off and set it on the floor.  It does require 2 AA batteries, although the demo ones that came in it worked well for a couple days to start with.

My family members are bread bakers and artists and we like to be challenged.  After a tasty dinner and some beverages, we clear the table and jump in to this game that can surprise us as the scoring progresses.  Being that the dohdler or the dohdlees can all score, anything can happen.  Playing the game with a group that did not know each other well got off to a slower start, but once the testing of boundaries moved into the fine line between too obvious a sculpture and the obscure creation, we were entertained over the period of more than an hour.  Since the dough is reused, I insisted that all hands be washed prior to playing and nobody minded once they realized my motivation.  I expect that I will eventually be purchasing a replacement dough, though.\"\\n',\n",

Another great feature about this case is that it has a hook you can use to hang it up.  Additionally,  you can also fold the case and close it using the velcro.

       " '\"This toy is a knock-it-out-of-the-park hit.  Sure, the toy is, as one reviewer noted, &#34;limited play.&#34;  The &#34;limited&#34; part is that it does five things, and requires a ton of room, like a family room or a really big outdoor area.  Blaze does not work well on carpeting.  Though Blaze &#34;only&#34; does five things, periodically you get cued to give Blaze a hand, like filling his tires or revving his engine.<br /><br />Blaze is surprisingly heavy, but the weight is needed to help Blaze do his multiple stunts.  A lever automatically lowers to help Blaze do his various stunts.  Technically, Blaze only does five things, four of which are stunts, but Blaze seems to do a bit of ad-libbing from time to time that makes the five stunts seem like a lot more.  Blaze lifts up from the back, from the front, from the side, and does tail spins.  Blaze also talks and provides his own music.  Admittedly, the talking and music can get a little old, but it is so amusing to watch Blaze do tricks that we had little time to be bored.<br /><br />The only &#34;down side&#34; to Blaze is that Blaze requires a LOT of area without carpeting to do his stunts.  Blaze does have a power mode that works okay on carpet, but any stunts that use the automatic lever work much better on a relatively smooth surface, like a concrete or hardwood floor.<br /><br />We have had many different toy vehicles over the decades, some of which were nearly the cost of this vehicle.  Many of those vehicles only did one thing.  Occasionally they might do something else, like pop a wheelie.  But none of those vehicles would do all the things this vehicle will do.  Frankly, I would have loved this toy as a child.  What the heck, I love this toy as an adult.  Then there are the grandchildren, if they can get it away from grandpa.<br /><br />Enjoy!\"\\n',\n",

This is based on a balloon. Do you really expect it to take abuse? C\\'mon man<br />2. This is based on a balloon filled with helium. You take it outside and it either flies away or doesn\\'t stay put. Really?<br /><br />This is a novelty item for indoor use only and not a high end R/C aircraft. My kid loves it and my office mates get a kick out of flying past their cubes. If you want high end R/C then you are in the wrong section. With this said I love mine and when I break it, i\\'ll buy the replacement balloon and keep it flying.\"\\n',\n",

There are lots of things for Sandy and her little pink dolphin friend to do â\\x80\\x93 drive the boat, ride the zip line, eat a turkey dinner,  go down the water slide, splash in the pool, take a bath and even go to bed.<br /><br />Each area on the Ocean Cruiser has a sensor and when Sandy touches it, she talks specifically about being in that area â\\x80\\x93 with multiple phrases for each area.  You never knew what she was going to say!<br /><br />Sandy comes with multiple outfits and hairdos so that she can transform her look depending on what kind of play your child is having with her.  The boat also flips up so children can play with Sand both outside and inside the boat.<br /><br />Sandyâ\\x80\\x99s House & Ocean Cruiser was easy to put together â\\x80\\x93 all I had to do was just snap pieces into place.  There is also a detailed diagram for all the decals.  It took about 7 minutes in total to prep for my daughter.<br /><br />What I really like about this set is how it stimulates my daughterâ\\x80\\x99s imaginative play.  Itâ\\x80\\x99s also great that Sandy is a Marine Biologist, talking about dolphins and even a whale â\\x80\\x93 she will definitely inspire girls to go into science and into careers that helps others.<br /><br />â\\x80\\x9cThe product has been provided by VTech so you could experience it with your family; however, the thoughts and opinions are all your own.â\\x80\\x9d\"\\n',\n",

It even comes with one.  So if you are like me, and prefer the feel of an octagonal restrictor gate, there\\'s going to be a learning curve.  When you switch gates like that, you end up losing roughly half of the diagonal sensitivity, because of the way the microswitches are placed.  So while you have a smoother overall motion, you need to be very deliberate in hitting all of the directions.<br /><br />Now this isn\\'t a knock against the joystick, even though it may seem like it.  This is more of a warning to anyone who might be thinking of switching the gate out.  And even then, the replacement gates are pretty cheap, and take about 20 seconds to install.  I\\'m still quite happy I put one of these in my arcade stick, because they feel great to use, and it contrasts well with my black case.<br /><br />So as far as I\\'m concerned, this is the best joystick I\\'ve used.

       " '\"My granddaughter loves her Cozy Coup.  I was so excited when my daughter got this for her daughter - as I have many fond memories of both of my children playing with their cozy coup\\'s when they were toddlers.  The design hasn\\'t changed a lot in the over 25 years since my kids had these - I guess if something isn\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it.  One nice feature about the newer models is they are taller and I am able to push my 18 month old granddaughter in her &#34;car&#34; without it breaking my back.  I am only 5\\'5&#34; and I think anyone much taller then me would have to bend though.<br /><br />I put the coup together and used the on-line video instruction and it made the job very easy.  I did it by myself and had no issues.  I am a visual person so this was much better than the instruction manual.  Following the video step-by-step will assure you don\\'t put anything together bassackwards .... you do not want to try and take this baby apart believe me.  After I put it together we took it for a few spins in the house on the hardwood floors and one of the front wheels did not operate properly - it was kind of &#34;frozen&#34; and wouldn\\'t swivel like it should.  I called Little Tikes and their rep was very friendly and helpful.  Once we took it outside on the concrete it worked perfectly.  Couldn\\'t get the necessary traction inside (probably not an ideal inside toy anyway but with grandparents, we have a whole different set of rules than we did for our own kids lol!) .<br /><br />Get one of these for your kids or grandkids - they will love it - and so will you.\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"Iron Maiden has always featured Eddie &#34;The Head&#34; on all of their album artwork, as well as in their stage performances. This particular Eddie is represented on the album Piece of Mind.<br /><br />I\\'ve never owned one of the new NECA mego styled figures, so I had no idea what to expect. I\\'m glad I got this one, he is quite an awesome figure.<br /><br />The sculpt of his head is a dead on representation of the album artwork, and the face is scary as it should be. Every detail was paid attention too, down to the tiny screws holding the plate that holds his head together. This is one of the best head sculpts I have ever seen on an action figure. The feet are sculpted equally grotesque, and they look appropriately Eddie. From the knee up, however, he is a plain, flesh toned &#34;buck&#34; body. His collar around his neck is very well sculpted as well, straight down to the tiny little lock that looks as though it holds it shut. It even features real metal chains attached to it.<br /><br />Paint on Eddie is fantastic. The face is so detailed that Eddie appears to have crawled right out of the album artwork. His teeth, tongue, eyes, and even the bit of blood dripping from his skull cap are expertly applied. The only thing that costs this figure points on paint is that NECA have decided to &#34;shade&#34; the head and collar like on the album artwork, and not on the clothes, so he looks to be half shaded. Even with the jarring paint shading on his head and collar, he is still an amazing portrayal of Eddie.<br /><br />The cloth clothes are very nice, in my opinion. His jeans are appropriately ripped and have been &#34;stained&#34; to appear dirty. The straightjacket is amazing, and has lots of straps on the back as it should. Both the pants and straightjacket have Velcro on them, and while the pants are easily removed, I can not see any way to take the straightjacket off without damaging it. Looks like Eddie is permanently restrained.<br /><br />The articulation on Eddie is pretty good too. He has a double ball jointed head/neck that allows a nice range of motion, though it is a little tight. His legs have hinged hips, swivel thighs, hinged knees, and hinged ankles. The legs allow a nice range of motion, however it does feel slightly limited due to the cloth jeans. The upper body has a waist swivel, and the arms are as articulated as the legs. The straightjacket however prevents most motion though, and while his arms are slightly movable, they will never have the range of articulation that other figures have.<br /><br />Overall, this NECA mego styled Eddie, from the classic Iron Maiden album Piece of Mind, is a must have for fans of the band and these NECA figures. Highly reccomended.\"\\n',\n",

She told me to think of the ones used for golf.  When I switched her to them, I did notice an improvement with her writing.  One day, while I was casually browsing Crayola product on Amazon, I came across these. I was so excited that I immideately purchased them for my daughter (and I) to use.  She loves them, as do I.  She can finally color without breaking the tool she is using, which happens with her and crayons frequently. This set has every color you need, and a convienent built in sharpener.  Really just everything you need.  I loves these so much that I plan on buying her a second set for Christmas.\"\\n',\n",

It kind of felt like we were going to visit princesses at Disney and play games with them and dress up like them!  She loved the different games, and that you just answer a few questions and then get to play.  We especially loved how you unlock new dresses and accessories and hairstyles and then you can take your picture wearing those.  It really made her feel like a princess.  It\\'s also nice that some of the games are body interactive, to get your child moving but it\\'s also easier for the little ones to do than using the controller but sometimes they motion is a little too sensitive and causes them to get an answer wrong accidentally.  There are lots of games within this cartridge and well worth it.\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"Pro\\'s: 1)  RC car is great for my 7 y/o.  Bought it for his birthday.  Its quick, fun, and tears through most anything he hits.  Drives very fast on the driveway and road.  Hits the unmowed lawn with speed and maintains it throughout.  Up and down ditches like a champ.  Through mulched beds with ease.  He drives it through the forest in the back yard over hills and dirt bike ramps with ease too. 2) For a 7 y/o it took a few runs to get used to the skid steer, but that was expected. 3) OUTSTANDING customer service.  His left wheels started to \\'stick\\' causing the car to not drive straight when commanded.  This happened w/in 3 months of purchase.  Emailed Kidzlane, and they took care of it with ease!  Very impressed with their desire to maintain good customer relations!  Thanks Kidzlane!  Cons: 1) Easy to flip.  If he drives to hard into a steep hill, or hits reverse on both wheels when going full speed forward, the vehicle will flip.  No biggie, but it scratches the roof. 2) Battery installation is difficult, requiring a screwdriver (provided).  Understand it\\'s needed to keep watertight battery compartment, but I would think a quick latch system would work. 3) Battery life can be less than desired.  Quick solution was to purchase additional batteries for hours of fun.  Overall - this car is a beast for it\\'s price, and my boy is loving every minute of it.  Kidzlane has been outstanding in their service.  Highly recommend purchasing this if you are considering an inexpensive RC car for your child.  Update, Dec 2015. I can\\'t praise the Customer service of Kidzlane enough!  Our toy broke again, a plastic gear in the wheels stripped.  Kidzlane replaced for free!  If you like amazing Customer service - Go with these guys!\"\\n',\n",

Same for the wrench.  The saw doesn\\'t do much but I don\\'t actually want my kid sawing things lol.

(For some reason, the newer AMT Round 2 model of this kit isn\\'t available at all anywhere that I could find.) Last week, when I saw it was down to $24.99, I knew I couldn\\'t pass that up. Package arrived mint-in-box, and, even though one corner was a little crumpled, everything inside was still wrapped and in new condition. I was extremely pleased with how well the pieces of this kit went together. With the other kits from 20+ years ago, I\\'d always had trouble with some pieces not fitting correctly due to age and/or warping. But I got lucky with this one. Everything fit and glued together just like it was supposed to. And, as usual, I went with my own color scheme. It looks great sitting on my shelf next to the battlecruiser from Star Trek VI.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I purchased a second kit, and I decided to try a different color scheme. (Plus, I think I like the attack mode wing configuration better than the flight mode.) Although I\\'m still not sure I chose the right shade of green for the ship\\'s hull, I definitely like the second color scheme better than the first.\"\\n',\n",
