    "You are a business analyst working for a major US toy retailer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A manager in the marketing department wants to find out the most frequently used words in positive reviews (five stars) and negative reviews (one star) in order to determine what occasion the toys are purchased for (Christmas, birthdays, and anniversaries.). He would like your opinion on **which gift occasions (Christmas, birthdays, or anniversaries) tend to have the most positive reviews** to focus marketing budget on those days.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are malformed characters in the review text. For instance, notice the `&#34;` - these are examples of incorrectly decoded [HTML encodings](https://krypted.com/utilities/html-encoding-reference/).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"amazing quality first of all, these cards are amazing proxies (but don't try to use em in &#34;official duels&#34; unless a judge is okay with it, if you have the real thing to show) and look amazing in your binder!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Please clean up all instances of these incorrect decodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One of your product managers suspects that **toys purchased for male recipients (husbands, sons, etc.)** tend to be much more likely to be reviewed poorly. She would like to see some data points confirming or rejecting her hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **regular expressions to parse out all references to recipients and gift occassions**, and account for the possibility that people may spell words \"son\" / \"children\" / \"Christmas\" as both singular and plural, upper or lower-cased.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explain what some of **pitfalls/limitations** are of using only a word count analysis to make these inferences. What additional research/steps would you need to do to verify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Create a simple text file that contains 2-3 lines at most describing yourself, your background, and interests. It must contain at least 1 emoji and 4-5 international characters (non-ASCII)**. Make sure to properly encode the file so that I can open it in `UTF-8` to read. I must be able to read all characters properly. Attach it to your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform the same word count analysis using the reviews received from Amazon to answer your marketing manager's question. They are stored in two files, (`poor_amazon_toy_reviews.txt`) and (`good-amazon-toy-reviews.txt`). **Provide a few sentences with your findings and business recommendations.** Make any assumptions you'd like to- this is a fictitious company after all. I just want you to get into the habit of \"finishing\" your analysis: to avoid delivering technical numbers to a non-technical manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submit everything as a new notebook and Slack direct message to me (Yu Chen) and the TA the HW as an attachment.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: Name the notebook `lastname_firstname_HW1.ipynb`."

The factory / designer made no effort whatsoever to calibrate their design so it actually works.<br /><br />Issues :<br />1, The space helmet has no way staying on the astronaut, the sizing is so off the sits on his head like he just grabbed the closes planter near by and called it a helmet.  Trying to place the astronaut in the spaceship with the helmet on is impossible.  There is not enough clearance to close the cockpit. So the helmet is useless, it just constantly falls off causing frustration.<br /><br />2, Ok issue number one can be explained by, oh son he does not need the helmet in the spaceship ok.....  However, the pilot itself it to large for the cockpit. A person really has to finagle and shove the guy in there to fit and for the cockpit to close.  Same goes for getting him in and out again  This is BS since the fundamental point of the toy.<br /><br />Dear toy maker, let me tell you the &#34;User Story&#34; for the product. Three year old using imagination play with spaceship and astronout having adventures.  For this the astronout has to be able to get in and out of his spaceship and travel to other locations and rinse and repeat.  What they should not be doing is getting frustrating with trying put together 3 pieces of outerly poorly designed garbage..\"\\n',\n",

I refer to your Cell Block Psycho childrenâ\\x80\\x99s costume with the description that reads, &#34;Kids will look psychotic with our scary Cell Block Psycho Child Costume. With a look resembling Hannibal Lector, no other convict will dare mess with this one. Our kids\\' Cell Block Psycho Costume includes an orange prisoner jumpsuit featuring torn sleeves, one attached tattoo sleeve, zipper front and \\'Ward 10-31 print, broken wrist shackle and a brown half face constraint mask. The molded plastic half mask features bars over the mouthpiece cutout for the scary look of Hannibal Lector the cannibal. No one on their cell block will dare to mess with this serial kill mental patient in our scary Cell Block Psycho Costume for kids.&#34; My younger daughter, once an honor student, athlete and musician before her illness presented during the onset of adolescence, has lived with schizoaffective disorder for the past six years, and was hospitalized as a child.  Weâ\\x80\\x99ve taken her to UCLA and Stanford, as well as our local hospitals, hoping to make sense of her devastating illness.  If you have ever spent anytime visiting a loved one in a childrenâ\\x80\\x99s/adolescentâ\\x80\\x99s mental health treatment facility, I assure you, you would understand that this costume is painfully cruel. Childhood suffering is not an appropriate inspiration for a Halloween costume.  Vampires are not real.  Mummies come-to-life, monsters and zombies are not real.  Cartoon characters, fairy princesses and action heroes are not real.  Those types of costumes are appropriate to sell for children for Halloween.  But childhood and adolescent mental illness is very real.  I doubt you would sell a Stage Four Cancer costume.  Why would you sell a costume that makes fun of a severe brain disorder? Stigma only encourages hopelessness and despair.  Please reconsider stigmatizing our daughterâ\\x80\\x99s very real illness by removing your Cell Block Psycho Costume and other mental illness inspired costumes from your inventory.\"\\n',\n",

The bag contained 3 colors of chests--purple, pink, and orange.

The next one was was missing a tab that secures the &#34;lock&#34;--it didn\\'t stay closed. A third purple chest was missing a tab, so of course that one wouldn\\'t stay closed. I tested 20 of these chests, and only 6 would stay closed. After some quick calculating I realized that out of 144 chests, there probably were only around 40 that would stay closed.

Its basically a dog toy sold in a set for kids. You can get a much better soccer ball for children at any sports store. As for the sticks and net, what you are getting is basically HALF of what you need to have any real fun. You get one net, and two sticks. But there are four attachments for those sticks: two hockey and two lacrosse. The attachments go on by way of a crude lock-in system that requires pushing very gently on a button-- to make the attachments go on-- but that requires a very HARD push to get them off again. My son and I could not get the lacrosse attachments off the sticks except by squeezing HARD on that button. Unfortunately, one of the buttons was squeezed so hard that it went in-- and did not pop back out again. Now that stick is junk. We have just one stick now and its staying on its lacrosse setting. You\\'ll need to buy extra sticks if you want to enjoy this set with less stress, so that your hockey and lacrosse sticks are ready when your kids are and don\\'t need to be changed. But I wouldn\\'t even bother buying this set for its sticks because they are made from clunky metal-- why not just get your kids the right sized, lower-end equipment made from wood or plastic and that requires no assembly? The set makes enjoying sports horribly complicated.<br /><br />The net went together easily enough, but its not something I\\'d want to take apart and do over again each time they wanted to play. So it takes up a large part of our basement. What I dislike most about the set is the cheapness of the materials. It has great gift appeal: It was my preschooler\\'s favorite birthday present and his 7-year-old brother was even excited when it was opened. The picture on the box had my kids giddy to take it out right away. But once we had it out, and realized how little there really was to play with, the qualityof which was all around inferior, our excitement waned and this toy will probably make an appearance in next year\\'s yard sale. Its a flashy toy with excellent gift appeal: Its best use is pretend-play for little kids. But keep in mind it has all the caveats of a self-assembled toy.\"\\n',\n",

The first time it put it in the water it ran for about a minute and stopped steering. Retrieved it and it was full of water which killed the steering servo.  Sent it back for an exchange. Got the new one and it did the same thing within a minute.  Here\\'s the list of modifications I had to do to make it right.  1 - steering linkage wire is way to thin and does not make a watertight seal through the cheap rubber seal in the hull.  Had to fabricate a new through-hull seal.  2- when you reverse the boat it floods because the hull is 2 pieces and NOT sealed with any kind of glue or rubber.  Tried to separate the hull and the nose is glued in place so removing the 4 screws only allowed the rear pieces to partially separate. Used aquaseal around the seam where I could.  The connection plug to the steering servo gets wet with the slightest amount of water in the hull so agua sealed the plug. 3 - even when the steering servo worked, it does not push the rudder to its limits so the boat barely steers.  Had to fabricate extension levers for both the servo and the rudder to get the servo to push the rudder to its limits.  the rudder also had a tab that stopped it from steering to the limit on 1 side so had to grind that off as well.  SAVE YOUR MONEY - and buy a product that has had some R&D put into it.  After about 6 hours of labor in my workshop the thing finally works for more than a minute - it does go fast though but seriously not worth the money or effort.

First negative is that you need 10 AAA batteries, so we had to make trip to the store before he could even get started.  The game board is really thin and flimsy, so it has to be played on a hard surface.  Overall there is a lot of variety with the toy and what you can do. The excitement and fun fades really fast.  There are much better choices for you child in this price range.  I asked my 9 year old if he felt one star was a fair rating and he said yes.\"\\n',\n",

First of all, the head separated to several parts in the first place, so that I have to carefully connect them together which is a very complicated work to do. But it is just a beginning. I also figured out that the tail can not be connected to the body because the articulation is basically wrong ! The hold used to articulate is way too small, it is impossible to connect the tail. Moreover, other articulations are very easy to detach, especially the toes. When I tried to adjust the post, they just detached. It is very uncommon. The quality should not suppose to be that terrible. Therefore, I have to conclude that it is a faulty product. Ironically, the seller is Amazon.Com. I don\\'t know if they did it for purpose.

He is in construction and even he was frustrated putting this together. After about an hour, we figured out there were so many pieces missing we couldn\\'t even finish, and I don\\'t mean 1 or 2 pieces missing, or even 5-6 for that matter. Also, the Zombies are supposed to stand on a, what I would call a Lego type brick. They would not stay on the brick.
