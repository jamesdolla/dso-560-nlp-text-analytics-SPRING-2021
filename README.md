# DSO560 Natural Language Processing & Text Analytics

## Slack Workspace

We will be using Slack workspaces for most of our course communications, including submitting
classwork, homework, and grading.

Your final grades will be posted on Blackboard, but feedback for assignments will be delivered via Slack.

Prior to Week 1's session, please [join the Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/dso560textana-piq5399/shared_invite/zt-nlx7nesm-HlMz4BM7yDfj83E1HEQCUg). **Note that this is a different Slack workspace than the auto-created workspaces by USC Marshall** (I am creating my own workspace since I need extra permissions to automate sending grades / notifications via the Slack chatbot apps).
